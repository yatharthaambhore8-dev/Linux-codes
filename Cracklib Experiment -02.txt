Objective:
To understand the importance of strong passwords and evaluate different types of passwords
using tools like cracklib-check, pwscore, and zxcvbn on Kali Linux.

Theory:
What is Password Strength?
Password strength is a measure of how resistant a password is to guessing and brute-force
attacks. Strong passwords are:
•	At least 12–16 characters long
•	Contain a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
•	Avoid common words, names, or predictable patterns
•	Not reused from other accounts

Commands : 
Sudo apt update 
Git clone https://github.com/cracklib/cracklib.git 
Sudo apt install nodejs npm 
Sudo npm install -g zxcvbn

echo " Yathartha2727" | cracklib- check 

echo " @Y#23&" | pwscore
zxcvbn --user-input "yathartha@2713"
