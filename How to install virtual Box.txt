Step 1: Download and Install VirtualBox
•	Open your browser and visit https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads.
•	Download VirtualBox for Windows hosts.
•	Run the installer.
•	Keep default settings.
•	Allow network features and drivers when prompted.

Step 2: Download Kali Linux ISO
•	Visit https://www.kali.org/get-kali/.
•	Download the Kali Linux 64-bit ISO installer.
•	Save it to an easy-to-access folder.

Step 3: Create a New Virtual Machine (VM)
•	Open VirtualBox and click "New."
•	Give a name like "KaliLinux."
•	Set Type to Linux.
•	Set Version to Debian (64-bit).
•	Allocate RAM: 2-4 GB (4096 MB recommended).
•	Create a virtual hard disk: 20-40 GB recommended.

Step 4: Attach Kali Linux ISO to VM
•	Select the Kali Linux VM in VirtualBox.
•	Go to Settings → Storage → Select "Empty."
•	Click the disk icon and choose the Kali ISO you downloaded.
•	Click OK.

Step 5: Start the Virtual Machine and Install Kali Linux
•	Click Start to boot the VM from the ISO.
•	Select "Graphical Install."
•	Choose your language, region, and keyboard layout.
•	Configure network (use NAT for internet access).
•	Set username, password, and hostname.
•	Partition disk (select Guided – use entire disk for simplicity).
•	Complete installation and reboot.

Step 6: Remove ISO After Installation
•	After reboot, go to Devices → Optical Drives → Remove disk from virtual drive.
•	Reboot VM to ensure it boots from the virtual hard disk.

Step 7: Update Kali Linux
•	Open Terminal inside Kali.
•	Run:
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
•	This ensures all system packages and penetration testing tools are up to date.

Outcome
•	Kali Linux is now installed on VirtualBox.
•	You have a secure, isolated virtual lab to safely practice penetration testing and ethical hacking.

Conclusion
Using VirtualBox to run Kali Linux allows safe exploration of cybersecurity tools without affecting your main OS. Proper setup with updates ensures a smooth, effective penetration testing environment for learning and projects.
