Objective:
To understand social engineering techniques by simulating a phishing attack in a controlled
lab environment using the Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) in Kali Linux.

Theory:
Phishing is a social engineering attack where attackers trick users into revealing
confidential information (such as usernames, passwords, or financial data) by posing as a
trusted entity, often via fake websites or emails.
Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) is a framework in Kali Linux designed for penetration
testing and simulating social engineering attacks for educational purposes.
Types of Phishing Simulations in SET:
- Website Cloner: Duplicates a real login page to capture credentials.
- Credential Harvester: Captures usernames and passwords entered on a phishing page.
- Email Phishing: Sends a crafted phishing email with malicious links.
