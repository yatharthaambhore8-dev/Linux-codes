Hashing is one-way, meaning the original password cannot be directly recovered.

To check the strength of passwords and to perform security auditing, tools like John the Ripper (JtR) are used.
John the Ripper is an open-source password-cracking tool.

CONCLUSION (Simple & Easy Language)

In this practical, we learned how Linux saves password hashes securely in the /etc/shadow file and how these hashes can be analyzed using John the Ripper.
By performing password cracking using a wordlist, we observed that:

Weak or common passwords can be cracked easily.

Strong passwords are difficult or impossible to crack using simple attacks.



Commands for John The Ripper : 

sudo apt install john
John 
echo 'a' | md5sum
echo ' Hash value' > hash.txt 

john --format=raw-md5 --incremental hash.txt

john --format=raw-md5  --wordlist=/home/yathartha/all-seclists.txt hash.txt

cat hash.txt
